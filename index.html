subtitle: I start this blog, somehow wishing it would lead me into an experience and knowledge in a new and exciting development area. I plan to blog about my journey as a developer and programmer, along with my thoughts and what I've learned. I hope reading my content can impact your journey in life positivly, even a fraction of an angle, then it feels worth while.
