It's been 10 months since I've stepped into the "programming" world. I was so insanely captivated by the world of coding that for the first six months, I've literally spent all my time, at least 12 hours a day, on researching, learning, and practicing how to code or anything related to programming. I remember one day not being able to sleep because I was so curious and excited about what I would learn the next day. In my seventh month, I was so hungry for real genuine experience in coding, where I begged my way into a job as a graduate developer level role in a software development company. I spent days, nights, and weekends working, not because I had to, but only because it was so-much-fun. After only 3 months in the job, I became the project manager of a VR app dev project and was promoted to the lead of my dev team.

An enormous amount of information and knowledge has stacked up in my brain, and I feel like a totally different person compared to when I first set foot into this world. But yet... I am starving for more.... I am so hungry for more knowledge about any or all fields of programming... I wish I had known about this in my youth years, then I would be able to consume and absorb much more, much faster...
